# Electronic Component Inventory Project Enhancement

## Current System State
The application currently provides electronic component inventory management with the following features:
- Location-based tracking and management
- Component categorization and metadata
- Quantity tracking
- Search functionality
- Barcode integration for rapid lookups

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Project Base Structure
**Complexity: 2/5**
**Purpose:** Establish foundation for project-based component management

Required Implementation:
- Project schema with core fields:
  ```typescript
  interface Project {
    id: string
    name: string
    dateCreated: Date
    components: ProjectComponent[]
    availabilityPercentage: number
    costRemaining: number
  }
  ```
- CRUD operations implementation
- Project listing view with sorting/filtering
- Detailed project view with component management

### 2. Component-Project Association
**Complexity: 3/5**
**Purpose:** Enable inventory allocation and tracking within projects

Required Implementation:
- Component association interface:
  ```typescript
  interface ProjectComponent {
    componentId: string
    quantityNeeded: number
    priority?: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
    dateNeeded: Date
  }
  ```
- Quantity allocation system
- Component search/add workflow
- Real-time availability tracking
- Completion percentage calculator

### 3. Missing Components Management
**Complexity: 3/5**
**Purpose:** Track and manage procurement needs for unavailable components

Required Implementation:
- Extended ProjectComponent interface:
  ```typescript
  interface ProjectComponent {
    estimatedCost?: number
    purchaseUrl?: string
  }
  ```
- Shopping list view implementation
- Priority ranking system (1-5)
- Project cost remaining calculator
- Purchase URL management

### 4. Allocation Queue System
**Complexity: 4/5**
**Purpose:** Manage component distribution across multiple projects

Required Implementation:
- Priority-based allocation logic
- Secondary sorting by timestamp
- Allocation event handlers
- Automatic status updates
- Component availability triggers
- Reallocation system

### 5. Project Status Dashboard
**Complexity: 2/5**
**Purpose:** Provide project overview and status monitoring

Required Implementation:
- Status overview UI components
- Advanced filtering/sorting capabilities
- Cost summary displays
- Availability percentage visualization
- Shopping list integration
- Project readiness indicators

## Implementation Order
1. Project Base Structure
2. Component-Project Association
3. Missing Components Management
4. Project Status Dashboard
5. Allocation Queue System

This order maximizes incremental value delivery while managing implementation complexity. Each phase builds upon previous functionality while maintaining system stability.
