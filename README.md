# ECI - Electronic Component Inventory
>*or "help i can't stop ordering the wrong things for the projects that i haven't started yet "*

**Electronic Component Inventory.** Multi-faceted hosted database application built to solve critical quality-of-life problems, such as:
- I'm pretty sure I bought like 5 of those A100k pots recently. Am I really out?
- Glad I got a box of components in the mail. Wish I could remember if I needed these parts for something or if it's just general restock.
- I'm placing a small order at a vendor and should fill out some more items to make the most of the shipping charge I have to pay. What am I almost out of and what do I need coming up?
- There's only THREE places I ever put components in, and I can't, for the life of me, remember which place I put it in, and all three of them would take hours to go through.
- Ok fine, I'm out of 11k resistors. Do I have any 10k's in stock?
